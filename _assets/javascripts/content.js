Many were quick to blame refugees and call for tightened security or even border closings, especially when a Syrian passport -- which turned out to be fake -- was found near one of the terrorists. This xenophobic scapegoating, employed by European and American politicians alike, is based on falsehood. The terror Paris experienced is exactly what Syrian refugees are fleeing. It’s times like these that we must hold most strongly to our values of helping the world’s most vulnerable, not blame the victims.'

They can return home once it is safe to do so. Or they can apply for resettlement in a third country. While most refugees would prefer to return home, it takes an average of 17 years for them to make it back. Yet, only a tiny fraction apply for resettlement in a third country -- about 150,000 of the 4.2 million Syrian refugees have applied. Those who apply in the U.S. -- a number totaling only about 22,000 in the past year -- must wait an average of 18 to 24 months for their application to be processed. The process includes thorough security vetting and extensive interviews with government and security officials.'
